# Prompts

### Display a map with my current position.
Big trouble: read the Google API key from file local.properties. This file is ignored by git (.gitignore) so that the key will never be uploaded to the GitHub repository.

I had to try for hours until Gemini provided a working solution.

### I want to track my position while hiking. Implement a button for starting and stopping the recording of positions.
No problems, Gemini provided working code.

### Now I want to export the recorded track in JSON format.
No problems, Gemini provided working code.

### On exporting the JSON display the contents
No problems, Gemini provided working code.
